                    <p>In 2010, I started my career in the telecommunications industry as a 'Tools Maker,' creating programs to collect data, generate reports, and develop automation tools. 
                    In 2022, I transitioned to a full-stack developer role at different Company, where I build dynamic websites to support the HR team.
