                            Designed for ease of use, this bot operates within Telegram to prevent the need for additional software installation. 
                            It supports seamless data handling, making it perfect for database imports and Excel tasks like VLOOKUP. </p>
                        <p>Powered by Python, the bot ensures efficient and accurate data conversion while keeping track of user interactions.</p>

                        <p>The Greeting Cards App is a creative solution I developed to make sending holiday messages more enjoyable and personalized. 
                            Instead of plain text messages, this app allows me to choose from various templates tailored that I made before for different recipients, whether it's my boss, colleagues, friends, or family. 
                            Each template can be customized with the recipient's name through a simple URL modification, ensuring a personal touch while keeping the process quick and easy.</p>
                        <p>All the artwork is vector-based and created by me with Inkscape. The programming is done using Angular with TypeScript.</p>

                            That's why I created Game. 
                            Making games often requires complex logic, involving various algorithms and mathematical calculations that are rarely encountered in full-stack development. 
                            This game serves as a fun and engaging way to improve those skills.</p>
                        <p>The Game features a captivating narrative with character dialogues that lead to a choice-driven ending.</p>
                        <p>Inspired by Onet, The game throws in some twists and additional mechanics that demand strategic thinking to solve the puzzles.</p>
